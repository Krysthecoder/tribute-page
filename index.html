                        Kentaro's History 
                    </h2>

He was best known for his acclaimed dark fantasy series Berserk, and as a result, he established one of the best-selling manga of all time, Miura's series Berserk impacted the manga medium and beyond the industries, inspiring not only new generations of Manga artists but also other industries such as videogames and art.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content_paragraph">
                        Miura was a huge fan of other works, that have impacted his life and workout, mangas such as <span class="important-mentions"> Fist of the North Star</span>, the Japanese fantasy novel series <span class="important-mentions">Guin Saga,</span> and cult films like <span class="important-mentions">Hellraiser series,</span> creating not just the dark feelings that are strongly present on his work, but also the creativity and taste of extreme scenes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content_paragraph">

                    <h3 class="work_content_title">King of Wolves</h3>
                    <p class="work_content_paragraph">Serialized in 1989, King of wolves is a collection of the first and second collaboration (Japan was the third) with Burosan, of Fist of the North Star fame. When you combine Burosan and Miura you know you're going to get two things. A world devoid of technology and one where the main character is a badass who can't be stopped by mortal hands. As expected both of those are here.</p>
                    <p class="work_content_paragraph">The usual tropes the two follow aside, this is a pretty good story. Two characters get sucked into 13th century Mongolia, one of which is forced into being a warrior slave under Genghis Khan himself. The only true downside to this book is it resolves a bit too quickly. It could have used some time to breathe, rather than moving at a breakneck pace.</p>

                        Gigantomachia
                    </h3>

                    <p class="work_content_paragraph">Serialized in 2013, This is the one work of Miura's that nears the lofty heights of his magnum opus, Berserk. If you only read one book on this list, this is the one to pick up. The art here is fantastic, capturing large cosmic level horrors in a light that very few artists can. Miura does a great job of capturing people's emotions through their eyes as well. Some of the looks from Prom really convey her emotionless state better than words could.</p>

                    <p class="work_content_paragraph">The story is top-notch as well, following a gladiator named Delos and a mystic girl named Prom as they try to heal the shattered world. These two have personalities that are such stark contrasts of one another, Delos being very carefree and Prom being almost robotic in nature. Beyond their dynamic, this story is all about the perseverance of man and always having hope. The moral being that we need to be able to forgive rather than rushing off for vengeance.</p>
